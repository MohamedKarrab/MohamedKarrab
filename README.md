# Mohamed Karrab

#### Cybersecurity Consultant & Penetration Tester
I break things so others can build them stronger.

- Focused on web app hacking, network penetration, and turning code flaws into real-world impact.
- Always sharpening the edge: scripting tools, automating recon, and more.
- Led the development of Alashwas — a hands-on cybersecurity learning platform.
- Outside the keyboard: deep into books on finance, strategy, and personal growth.
